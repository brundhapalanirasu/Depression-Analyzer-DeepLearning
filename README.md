# Depression Analyzer using Deep Learning ðŸ§ 

Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, especially for vulnerable groups such as women and children. With the rise in digital interactions and increased awareness of psychological challenges, there is a growing need for accessible, technology-driven mental health tools.

This project, **Depression Analyzer using Deep Learning**, is built with the vision of early detection and support. It utilizes cutting-edge AI models to analyze multiple data inputs such as:

* **Text responses** from users (e.g., answering a questionnaire or casual chat),
* **Audio inputs**, focusing on tone, pitch, and emotional cues,
* **Facial expressions** captured via image or video analysis.

The deep learning models are trained on validated datasets and psychological scoring systems like **PHQ-9**, ensuring the analysis aligns with clinical standards. Based on the results, the system generates a depression level score and provides one or more of the following:

* Suggests reaching out to a licensed professional,
* Offers interactive or gamified tasks to uplift mood,
* Connects to emergency mental health helplines.

This tool is designed to be part of a **safe, virtual mental wellness environment**, where users can interact anonymously and receive non-judgmental support. Though it's **not a diagnostic tool**, it can serve as a first step toward seeking help or raising awareness about one's mental state.
