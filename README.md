# Depression Analyzer using Deep Learning ðŸ§ 

This project aims to detect and analyze depression levels in **women and children** using **deep learning techniques**. The system can process **text inputs**, **audio signals**, or **facial expressions** to identify signs of depression and provide actionable feedback.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Detects depression severity using trained deep learning models.
- Accepts inputs via:
  - Text (questionnaire or chat)
  - Voice tone (via audio analysis)
  - Facial expressions (image/video processing)
- Outputs depression score or class (normal/mild/moderate/severe).
- Suggests solutions such as:
  - Doctor consultation
  - Gamified activities
  - Helpline contact
- Focused on **mental wellness of women and children**.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Natural Language Processing (LSTM / BERT)
- CNN for image/emotion detection
- Audio analysis using MFCC features
- Streamlit / Flask (for web interface)

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Sources
- [DAIC-WOZ](https://dcapswoz.ict.usc.edu/)
- [eRisk](https://erisk.irlab.org/)
- PHQ-9 / CES-D questionnaires

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Real-time video emotion tracking
- Multi-language support
- Integration with telehealth platforms
